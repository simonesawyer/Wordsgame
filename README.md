# Wordsgame
Based of the simple highway game where you try to create words from the three letters on a license plate. 
This is my interpetation in code. In the utility folder there is mainly pre-processing. Where
the list of acceptable words is created to contain words three letters or larger. There is 
also a brute force method to create a list of bad combinations of three letters that can not be made into
words.
